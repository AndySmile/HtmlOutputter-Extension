![Example Output](http://andysmiles4games.com/GitHub/Images/Output-Example.jpg)

## Description
This is an extension for the CppUnit library. It allows you to write your test results into a nice HTML file.
As addition it also includes a test case profile to be able to measure performing time for each test case. To add
this extension pretty simple and quick it was build as a library. Just compile it and add it to your project.
After small extensions in your existing code it is already ready to go.

It's based on the CppUnit v1.12.1, so you have to install it first before you're able to use this extension
within your project. You'll find it here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit/index.php?title=Main_Page
