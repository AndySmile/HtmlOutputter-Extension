HtmlOutputter-Extension
=======================

## Description
This is an extension for the CppUnit library. It allows you to write your test resuls into a nice HTML file.
It is still pretty simple but it does its job so far.

It's based on the CppUnit v1.12.1, so you have to install it first before you're able to use this extension
within your project. You'll find it here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit/index.php?title=Main_Page
